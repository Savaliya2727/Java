/* Exception Handling  

1. Write a Java program that takes two integers as input and performs 
division. Handle the ArithmeticException if the denominator is zero and 
display an appropriate message. 

2. Write a Java program that initializes an array of five integers. Take an 
index as input from the user and print the corresponding array element. 
Handle the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if an attempt is made to 
access an element beyond the array's bounds.  

3. Use multiple catch blocks to handle ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException 
and IllegalArgumentException separately. 

4. Create a custom exception class called InvalidInputException. Write a 
method that takes an integer as input and throws an 
InvalidInputException if the input is negative. Handle this custom 
exception. 

5. Create a custom exception, InvalidAgeException. Write a Java program 
that takes the age of a person as input and throws this exception if the 
age is less than 18. 

6. Write a Java program that creates a string variable and assigns it to null. 
Try to access its length and handle the NullPointerException. 

MultiThreading: 

7. Write a program to demonstrate multiple threads in the same java 
program.  

8. Write a Java program to create a thread that prints "Hello, World!" five 
times, with a delay of  5 seconds between each print statement. 

9. Create a thread that prints numbers from 1 to 10 with a 5-second pause 
between each number using Thread.sleep().  

10. Create a class that implements Runnable. Create a Thread object with an 
instance of your Runnable class and start it. 

11. Write a Java program that creates two threadsâ€”one thread prints even 
numbers from 1 to 20, and the other prints odd numbers from 1 to 20. 

12. Write a program to demonstrate Thread priorities.*/
